Create a new presentation. Child posts will be the slides in the presentation. The page order is the order in which the slides will be presented (use simple page ordering plugin to easily arrange the posts).

To view the presentation, append &full query var to the parent post URL. Use spacebar or arrow keys to navigate through the slides. 

See https://raw.github.com/bartaz/impress.js/master/index.html for documentation on the slide attributes.
